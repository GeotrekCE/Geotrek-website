The Alpes de Hautes-Provence Department has created a [Geotrek and Opendata](http://www.rando-alpes-haute-provence.fr/informations/geotrek-et-opendata/) page on its [RANDO site](http://www.rando-alpes-haute-provence.fr). Its showcases the Geotrek tool, the opensource software and the Opendata approach in which the Alpes de Haute-Provence department is involved.

Moreover, the Departement shared on the Open Data Sud website the entire network PDIPR04 (6500 km of trails), the whole signage furniture for trails as well as the hiking trails from www.rando-alpes-haute-provence.fr.
