The Regional Nature Park of Haut-Jura launches its new platform <a href="http://randonature.parc-haut-jura.fr" target="_blank">http://randonature.parc-haut-jura.fr</a>, created with Geotrek and dedicated to hiking routes and outdoor activities in the park.

The website highlights hiking and interpretive trails and offers several services such as accommodation, catering spots, etc.

The Park innovates by having made the choice to integrate as POI all the signposts present on the routes which has the advantage of guiding the hiker more accuratly.
