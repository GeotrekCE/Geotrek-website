The Chemin des Parcs portal offers 1900 km of walks punctuated with 1400 points of interest at the option of 198 different routes. And this through 7 Regional Natural Parks in the PACA region.
 The pooling offered from the open source application Geotrek appealed for the enhancement of the overall offer of routes in this great territory. Each park has access to the application and enhances the common database, which has facilitated collaboration between the parks.
