<h2>A French and above all collective success</h2>
<p>
  Geotrek was created in 2013 through an Alpine project involving the Écrins and Mercantour national parks.
  It makes it possible to manage and promote the hiking offer as well as outdoor activities.
  From the start, this tool was created with open source code libraries and it was published under a free license so that it could be shared with other French actors
  In 2023, this success concerns more than 150 French structures including departments, national parks, regional natural parks, communities of municipalities as well as tourist offices.
</p>
<h2>A dynamic community of actors</h2>
<p>
  Since 2016, the partners have been united within the community of Geotrek users led by the Écrins National Park.
  The desire to share know-how, deployment experiences, the identification of common needs and the financing of developments to evolve the tool drives all stakeholders.
  It is thanks to this collective dynamic that the tool is perpetually evolving, so each actor who wishes to develop new functionalities finances it alone or with others and can put it back into the software which is updated and enriched for everyone.
</p>
<h2>A tool serving the promotion of territories and nature</h2>
<p>
  Beyond the trail management functionalities, Geotrek makes it possible to structure the region's hiking and outdoor activities offerings.
  Its users make it an asset for promoting the territories.
  The tool also allows to pass on information to discover in depth the heritage of natural and rural areas, as on the portal <a href="https://rando.ecrins-parcnational.fr" target="_blank">Rando Ecrins</a>
</p>
<p>
  Collective intelligence also made it possible to enrich the tool with possibilities for reporting problems observed by hikers.
  Geotrek also integrates environmental protection issues.
  It helps raise visitors' awareness of the regulations for protected areas, good practices in the natural environment as well as sensitive areas to avoid due to the presence of protected species.
</p>
<h2>A project resolutely turned towards the future</h2>
<p>
  After the establishment of a first public order group (2018-2022) the partners decided to set up another partnership agreement which will make it possible to finance new developments of the tool as well as the technical coordination of the community.
  This new consortium, currently being formed, concerns 22 public structures including 8 departments, 7 national parks, regional natural parks, several communities and tourist offices for the period 2024 to 2027.
  Ultimately, the partners aim to set up a structure dedicated to the development and financing of the project.
</p>
<h2>Another distinction at the public award</h2>
<p>
  The Geotrek project was also among the 22 nominees for the public award, for which voting closed on October 30 on the European Commission website.
  This prize was won by BlueHats, the French community of public agents contributing to free software, which includes the Écrins National Park and the Geotrek project.
  Geotrek won second place in this public award.
