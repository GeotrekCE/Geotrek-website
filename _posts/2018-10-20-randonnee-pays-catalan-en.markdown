__Big event__ : tourism office intercommunal Pyrénées Méditerranée (OTI)
 and [communes communauty Albères-Côte Vermeille-Illibéris](http://www.cc-alberes-cote-vermeille-illiberis.fr/)
 will reveal their new Geotrek website, on October, 27th and 28th during the 3rd meeting
 of Trekking in Pays Catalan.

This website dedicated to nature activites will show the wealthy terrestrian trekking diversity
 (hiking,  mountain byke, biking, riding) in the country…
 but won't be limited to it.

Indeed, l’OTI have decided to deploy [Geotrek solution](http://geotrek.fr/)
 to the following activities : **trail**, **diving** and **nautic activities**.

As a reminder, Pyrénées Méditerranée area is an amazing **sea and mountain land** in the middle of the nature,
 et includes **3 nature reserves**, almost unique in France.

Then Geotrek will allow the hikers to discover this land and its heritage,
 helped by a real digital guide.

Firstable with the website [rando.tourisme-pyrenees-mediterranee.fr](http://rando.tourisme-pyrenees-mediterranee.fr/)
 then thanks to the mobile application available in the coming months.

To answer quickly to this project, l’OTI has requested the society
 [Makina Corpus](https://makina-corpus.com/) which has show reactivity and agility
 to new practices not in the Geotrek product DNA.
