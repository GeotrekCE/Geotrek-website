Since the launch of the <a href="http://www.randoguadeloupe.gp/?categories=T1" target="_blank"> website</a> in December 2014, more than 73,000 visits have been recorded. Most of the Internet users come from Guadeloupe (44%) and Metropolitan France (37%). Thirty-four treks are currently available online, but the site is likely to evolve, both in terms of content and technical options.

New logo, new content, mobile application, translations, partnerships ...
